tl;dr:
- 10000-11000: Rolling stock/wagons etc, detailed below
- 60000-65999: Steam locomotives of the main characters
- 0-9999: British Rail-derived diesel/electric/MU classes etc

Rolling stock/wagons in the 100xx range

1. Express Coach
2. Annie & Clarabel

"Main character" steam Locomotives use the 60xx1-60xx9 range, where x is the train's number. Eg James (#5) uses ID's 51 and 52 for the engine and tender
Thomas uses 11. Toby uses 71-73 for Toby/Henrietta/Elsie.

Diesel/Electric units use their equivalent British Rail class with up to 10 vehicles per unit. Thus the range 0-9999 is reserved for TOPS designations (although it's unlikely that anything below 81 would ever be used)

Additional ranges may be reserved for things like the Skarloey railway etc
